dvorakanywhere: type dvorak keys from any qwerty keyboard.


Dvorak Anywhere lets you use the Dvorak keyboard when the computer is set to QWERTY. It's useful if you can't change the settings of your computer or if you're using someone else's machine. Just go to http://www.theworldofstuff.com/dvorak/dvorak.html and type in the box - the correct text will appear as if you were on a dvorak keyboard. You can copy and paste the text where you want it to go. For ultimate portability, save this page to your hard drive, email, or thumbstick, and take it with you!
